# GoCourse
Go (also known as Golang) is a programming language that was created at Google in 2007. It was designed to be efficient, concise, and easy to read, making it a good choice for developing large-scale, high-performance systems.
Here are some key features of the Go programming language:

Concurrency: Go has built-in support for concurrency, allowing developers to write programs that can execute multiple tasks simultaneously.

Garbage Collection: Go uses garbage collection to automatically free up memory that is no longer needed by a program.

Static Typing: Go is a statically typed language, meaning that the type of a variable is determined at compile-time, which can help catch errors before the program is executed.

Simplicity: Go was designed to be simple and easy to read, making it a good choice for large-scale systems that require many developers to work on the same codebase.

Fast Compilation: Go has a fast compiler that can compile large programs quickly, making it ideal for development environments where quick iteration is important.

Cross-Platform: Go can be compiled on a variety of platforms, including Windows, Linux, and macOS, making it a good choice for developing cross-platform applications.

Standard Library: Go has a large standard library that provides a wide range of functions and modules for common tasks, such as networking, encryption, and file I/O.

Go is used in a variety of applications, including web development, systems programming, and networking. Some popular projects that use Go include Docker, Kubernetes, and the Prometheus monitoring system. The simplicity, concurrency support, and fast compilation times make Go a popular choice for developing scalable, high-performance systems.
Functional programming is getting very popular and focuses on pure functions. Functional apps avoid shared state and tend to be more concise and predictable. In this course, Mirac will teach you how to code less and what's important when building apps over a basic go course.
